A herd immunity demonstration.

As you move the slide the demo executes 1000 SIR models with different initial R representing the x axis.

### Text from the model

<b>Herd Immunity Demonstration</b>
<br><br>
The vertical axis represents the percentage of a population infected during an epidemic.
<br><br>
The horizontal axis represents the percentage of the population who were immune at the
start of an epidemic; either through vaccination or previous exposure, recovery and 
long lasting immunity. 
<br><br>
Thus one vertical slice of the graph represents a whole epidemic. 
<br><br>
If the total number of people infected during an epidemic had a linear relationship to the 
number of people initially immune, we would expect to see the diagonal line shown.
<br><br>
In reality the total number of people infected is always less than that, as shown by the curved line.
<br><br>
The vertical distance between the two lines represents those people who were <i>indirectly protected</i>.
This is called herd immunity.
<br><br>
This herd effect is greatest at the herd immunity threshold (H) where the percentage of the 
population who are infected drops off dramatically; effectively protecting everybody who is
susceptible.  
<br><br>
Vaccination schedules target H for this reason and can in some cases
result in total eradication of a disease; smallpox for example.
<br><br>
The virulence of a disease is represented by the basic reproduction number (R0) and
can be thought of as the average number of people somebody will infect during the early 
stages of an epidemic.  
<br><br>
Use the green slider to change R0. 
<br><br>
As R0 increases, H increases (*) and the shape of the curve changes.  
<br><br>
Notice that herd effects other than those at or near H are minimal unless R0 is quite small.
<br><br>
Notice also when nobody is immune at the start of an epidemic (far left of the graph) the
percentage of the population infected is always above 50% and very quickly increases to 
near 100% as R0 increases.   
<br><br>
Here are some examples of R0:-
<br><br>
COVID-19: 1.5 to 4 (**)<br>
Smallpox: 4 to 7<br>
Rubella: 5 to 7<br>
Mumps 4: to 12<br>
Chickenpox: 10 to 12<br>
Pertussis: 12 to 18<br>
Measles: 12 to 18<br>
Zombies: 20+
<br><br>
(*) H=1-1/R0<br>
(**) May not give long lasting immunity.
